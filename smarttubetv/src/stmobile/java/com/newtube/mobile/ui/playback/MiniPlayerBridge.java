 * <p>The playback Activity OWNS the {@link ExoPlayer} (see {@link MobilePlaybackService} -
 * the service only wires the media session/notification, background audio already survives the
 * Activity being covered). Minimizing therefore does NOT move the player anywhere:
 * {@link MobilePlaybackActivity} stays alive behind {@code MobileBrowseActivity}, and the card
 * simply re-parents the player's session-long {@link SurfaceTexture} into its own TextureView
 * (see {@link #getSessionTexture()}) - the codec never notices the hand-off. This class is only
 * the bridge between those two activities: "is a mini session active?" plus lazy access to the
 * live player/video/texture (lazy so an engine restart inside the playback activity never
 * leaves the card holding released objects).</p>
 *
 * <p>All access is main-thread (activity lifecycle callbacks + view clicks), so plain statics
 * are safe. The activity is held weakly: if the system destroys the backgrounded player
 * activity, {@link #isActive()} turns false on its own and the bar simply hides.</p>
